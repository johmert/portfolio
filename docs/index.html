                    <header>
                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>I graduated from Knox College <em>Cum Laude</em> in 2014 with a Bachelor's of Arts
                        in Psychology, but I had taken an elective Intro To Computer Science course in one of
                        my last semesters and found a natural kinship. Directly out of school, I quickly rose to
                        a management position with GameStop, something I'm still very proud of. I enjoyed helping
                        my customers, and I loved working closely with my team to find new solutions to meet our goals.</p>
                    <p>I've spent the past few years playing with code, but as a student at 
                        <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" class="inline">Thinkful</a> I'm proud to say I've taken that biggest, 
                        final step to committing to software engineering as a career.</p>
                    <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer, looking to partner up for a hackathon, or would
                        like someone to study with, please reach out! I'm always looking to connect and build something
                        new and fun.</p>
